# CS105 Project: Car Rental Application

This project is part of the CS105 Introduction to Object Oriented Programming course at Özyeğin University. It involves developing a Java application for managing a car rental service. The project includes classes for vehicles, drivers, promotions, reservations, and the main rental company.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Students are tasked with implementing the provided UML class diagram and adding necessary fields, methods, constructors, and functionality to the classes. The project aims to enhance students' understanding of object-oriented design principles and their ability to apply them in real-world software development scenarios.

## Project Components

- **RentalCompany Class**: Central point of the application, responsible for managing the rental company's operations.
- **Reservation Class**: Represents a reservation and handles reservation-related data and operations.
- **Vehicle Classes**: Includes abstract and concrete classes for different types of vehicles (car, SUV, camper), each with its own rental restrictions and pricing.
- **Driver and Promotion Classes**: Represent drivers and promotions, respectively, and handle their data.

## Usage

1. Students are required to implement the provided UML class diagram by adding necessary fields, methods, constructors, and functionality to the classes.
2. The project emphasizes the use of encapsulation, polymorphism, method overriding, and inheritance to achieve clean and maintainable code.
3. Sample usage scenarios are provided to test the functionality of the implemented classes and methods.
